# Added value of feature uncertainty in the radiomic analysis of Contrast-Enhanced Digital Mammography images
This project aims to Assessment of feature uncertainty in CADx systems performance for breast immunohistochemical classification

## Goal
The purpose of this investigation is to show that the assessment of radiomic features (RF) uncertainty
can improve the robustness and performance of CADx classification models. A radiomic analysis
was designed to develop a classification model correlating RF, from CEDM images in its single-
energy (SET) modality, with the immunohistochemical status of a breast lesion.
